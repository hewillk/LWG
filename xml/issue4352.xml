<blockquote>
Except as otherwise noted, operations on `flat_multimap` are equivalent to
those of `flat_map`, except that `flat_multimap` operations do not remove
or replace elements with equal keys.
<p>
[<i>Example 1</i>: `flat_multimap` constructors and emplace do not erase
non-unique elements after sorting them.
&mdash; <i>end example</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This doesn't really work, because there is no `flat_map` operation that is
equivalent to the constructors and `insert` and `insert_range` functions that
take a `sorted_equivalent_t` tag argument. The `flat_map` operations that the
wording intends to refer to take a `sorted_unique_t` tag argument.
It's a bit of a stretch to say they're equivalent when they don't even have
the same parameters, so we need some weasel words here.

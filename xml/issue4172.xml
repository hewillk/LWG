The postconditions in <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique.cons]"/> paragraph 19:

<blockquote>
<i>Postconditions</i>:
`pm == u_p.pm` and `owns == u_p.owns`
(where `u_p` is the state of `u` just prior to this construction),
`u.pm == 0` and `u.owns == false`.
</blockquote>

contradict themselves if `*this` and the parameter `u` refer to the same object.
(Presumably "this construction" means the assignment, and it is copy-pasta from
the move constructor postconditions.) Apparently
`unique_lock` didn't get the memo that we require well-defined behavior
from self-move-assignment as of LWG <iref ref="2839"/>.
</p>
<p>
Also, the move assignment operator doesn't specify what it returns.
</p>

<note>2024-11-18; Casey expands the PR to cover `shared_lock`</note>
<p>
`shared_lock` has the same problems, and can be fixed in the same way.
</p>

<note>2025-02-07; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set status to Tentatively Ready after seven votes in favour during reflector poll.
</p>
<p>
"Should use parentheses not braces for the initializations."
Jonathan volunteers to do that editorially after this gets approved.

<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4993"/>.

<blockquote class="note">
Drafting Note: I've chosen to use the move-into-temporary-and-swap idiom here
to keep things short and sweet.
Since move construction, swap, and destruction are all `noexcept`,
I've promoted move assignment from "<i>Throws</i>: Nothing" to `noexcept` as well.
This is consistent with eliminating the implicit narrow contract condition
that `*this` and `u` refer to distinct objects.

<li>
<p>
In the class synopsis in <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique.general]"/>,
annotate the move assignment operator as `noexcept`:
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
  namespace std {
    template&lt;class Mutex&gt;
    class unique_lock {
      [...]
      unique_lock&amp; operator=(unique_lock&amp;&amp; u) <ins>noexcept</ins>;
      [...]
    };
  }
</code></pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Modify <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique.cons]"/> as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>
unique_lock&amp; operator=(unique_lock&amp;&amp; u) <ins>noexcept</ins>;
</code></pre>
<p>
-18- <i>Effects</i>:
<del>If `owns` calls `pm->unlock()`.</del>
<ins>Equivalent to: `unique_lock{std::move(u)}.swap(*this)`.</ins>
</p>
<p>
<ins>-?- <i>Returns</i>: `*this`.</ins>
</p>
<p>
<del>-19- <i>Postconditions</i>:
`pm == u_p.pm` and `owns == u_p.owns`
(where `u_p` is the state of `u` just prior to this construction),
`u.pm == 0` and `u.owns == false`.
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>-20- [<i>Note 1</i>:
With a recursive mutex it is possible for both `*this` and u to own
the same mutex before the assignment.
In this case, *this will own the mutex after the assignment and u will not.

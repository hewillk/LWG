<p>
Currently, it is unspecified whether any of <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> or <tt>operator&gt;&gt;</tt> 
for the "<i>unspecified</i>" return type of an I/O manipulating function is SFINAE-friendly.
<p/>
There's implementation divergence. E.g. the following program is consistently rejected by 
implementations although the standard doesn't strictly require it to be ill-formed. Among 
the implementations, libstdc++ and libc++ make the failure SFINAE-friendly, while MSVC STL 
doesn't (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rWYszoYa8">demo</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;

int main() 
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::setfill(L'*');
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It seems better to eliminate such implementation divergence. Perhaps it's also better to 
require them to be SFINAE-friendly to reduce potential conflicts with user-provided operators.
<p/>
If it's intended to allow implementation divergence, perhaps we should clarify the intent.

<p>
The specification of <code>affine_on</code> uses "current execution
resource" and it is unclear what that means exactly. Additionally,
it is unclear what the difference between <code>affine_on</code>
and <code>continues_on</code> is. The intended difference for
<code>affine_on</code> is to avoid unnecessary scheduling which
<code>continues_on</code> is already allowed to do in some cases,
too.
</p>
<p>
The intended semantics is that <code>affine_on</code> will either
complete inline on whatever execution agent it was started on or
it will complete asynchronously on the specified execution context.
With this formulation <code>affine_on</code> may complete on one
of two different execution context if it is started on an execution
context that is different from the one specified by the scheduler.

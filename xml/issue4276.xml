<title>`front()` and `back()` are not hardened for zero-length `std::array`s</title>

<discussion>
<p>
The intent of <paper num="P3471"/> "Standard library hardening" is clearly to provide hardened preconditions 
for members of sequence containers, including `std::array`. However, a zero-length `std::array` dodges this 
hardening by having undefined behavior for `front()` and `back()` explicitly specified in 
<sref ref="[array.zero]"/> paragraph 3.
<p/>
Without this paragraph, `front()` and `back()` would be hardened as well, as specified in <sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N5008"/>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[array.zero]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<del>-3- The effect of calling `front()` or `back()` for a zero-sized array is undefined.</del>
</p>
</blockquote>

Consider this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; v = 0;
// thread 1:
v.store(1, memory_order::release); // #1
// thread 2:
v.load(memory_order::acquire); // #2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Say, `#2` reads the value written by `#1`, `#1` synchronizes with `#2`. According to <sref ref="[intro.races]"/> p7:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 An evaluation <i>A</i> <i>happens before an evaluation</i> <i>B</i> (or, equivalently, <i>B</i> 
 happens after <i>A</i>) if either
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(7.1) &mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(7.2) &mdash; <i>A</i> synchronizes with <i>B</i>, or</p></li>
<li><p>(7.3) &mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, `#1` happens before <i>B</i>. However, <sref ref="[intro.execution]"/> p12 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For each
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(12.1) &mdash; function invocation,</p></li>
<li><p>(12.2) &mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(12.3) &mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
<i>F</i>, each evaluation that does not occur within <i>F</i> but is evaluated 
on the same thread and as part of the same signal handler (if any) is either 
sequenced before all evaluations that occur within <i>F</i> or sequenced after 
all evaluations that occur within <i>F</i>;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because both `v.store(...)` and `v.load(...)` are function invocations, and we can think that the member 
functions comprise some evaluations to form the operation, therefore, how are these evaluations that 
occur within the `store` ordered with those within the `load`?
<p/>
The rule only says the `store` synchronizes with the `load`, hence, the evaluation of the function 
call expression `v.store(...)` happens before the evaluation of the function call expression `v.load(...)`, 
but how about these evaluations occurring within these functions?
<p/>
A possible resolution might be: The order between all evaluations occurring within a function invocation 
and another evaluation <i>B</i> is determined by how the evaluation of the function call expression is 
ordered in relation to the expression <i>B</i>.
<p/>
For example, if `v.store()` happens-before <i>E</i>, then all evaluations occurring within the `store` 
happen-before <i>E</i>. As well, `v.store(...)` synchronizes with `v.load(...)`, then all evaluations 
occurring within `v.store(...)` synchronize with all evaluations occurring within `v.load(...)`.

<sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> says:

<blockquote>
If `charT` is `char`, `path::value_type` is `wchar_t`,
and the literal encoding is UTF-8, then the escaped path is
transcoded from the native encoding for wide character strings to UTF-8
with maximal subparts of ill-formed subsequences substituted with
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span>
replacement character per the Unicode Standard [...].
Otherwise, transcoding is implementation-defined.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This seems to mean that the Unicode substitutions are only done
for an escaped path, i.e. when the `?` option is used. Otherwise, the form
of transcoding is completely implementation-defined.
However, this makes no sense.
An escaped string will have no ill-formed subsequences, because they will
already have been replaced as per <sref ref="[format.string.escaped]"/>:
<blockquote>
Otherwise (<em>X</em> is a sequence of ill-formed code units),
each code unit <em>U</em> is appended to <em>E</em> in order as
the sequence <code>\x{<em>hex-digit-sequence</em>}</code>,
where <code><em>hex-digit-sequence</em></code> is the shortest hexadecimal
representation of <em>U</em> using lower-case hexadecimal digits.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
So only unescaped strings can have ill-formed sequences by the time
we do transcoding to `char`, but whether or not any
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span> substitution
occurs is just implementation-defined.
</p>

<p>
I believe we want to specify the substitutions are done when transcoding
an <em>unescaped</em> path (and it doesn't matter whether we specify it
for escaped paths, because it's a no-op if escaping happens first,
as is apparently intended).
</p>

<p>
It does matter whether we escape first or perform substitutions first.
If we escape first then every code unit in an ill-formed sequence is
individually escaped as `\x{hex-digit-sequence}`.
So an ill-formed sequence of two `wchar_t` values will be escaped as
two `\x{...}` strings, which are then transcoded to UTF-8.
If we transcode (with substitutions first) then the entire
ill-formed sequence is replaced with a single replacement character,
which will then be escaped as `\x{fffd}`.
SG16 should be asked to confirm that escaping first is intended,
so that an escaped string shows the original invalid code units.
For a non-escaped string, we want the ill-formed sequence to be
formatted as &#xfffd;, which the proposed resolution tries to ensure.

<note>2025-06-11; SG16 comments and improves wording</note>
<p>
The "and not converting from `wchar_t` to UTF-8" wording added in the index of implementation-defined 
behavior by the current proposed resolution should be changed to "and the literal encoding is not UTF-8".
<p/>
It was noted that "the literal encoding" is ambiguous in both the normative wording in 
<sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> p5 and in the new wording quoted above. In both cases, the intent 
is to refer to the "ordinary literal encoding". However, some SG16 participants were reluctant to include 
a drive-by fix with the proposed resolution for this issue since the ambiguous literal encoding reference i
s a pre-existing and separable issue. Those same SG16 participants were more concerned that the same 
wording was used in both <sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> p5 and in the corresponding entry of the 
implementation-defined behavior index. I would defer to the LWG chair to decide whether to address this 
as an additional related clarification with this change or as a separate editorial or LWG issue.
<p/>
The minimal change is to replace "and not converting from `wchar_t` to UTF-8" with "and the literal encoding 
is not UTF-8". The optional change is to insert "ordinary" before "literal encoding" as well. Once that is done, 
I'll have SG16 confirm they are content with the new proposed resolution.

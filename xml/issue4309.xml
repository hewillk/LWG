<title>How are two `seq_cst` operations ordered in the single total order if these two operations are unsequenced?</title>

Consider this snippet code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; flag = {0};
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; turn = {0};

if(flag + turn){}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The loads of `flag` and `turn` as the operands of `+` are unsequenced according to [intro.execution] p10.
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
Except where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of subexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, <sref ref="[atomics.order]"/> p4 says:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
There is a single total order <i>S</i> on all `memory_order::seq_cst` operations, including fences, 
that satisfies the following constraints.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then, it says that:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
First, if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are `memory_order::seq_cst` operations and <i>A</i> strongly happens 
before <i>B</i>, then <i>A</i> precedes <i>B</i> in <i>S</i>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
According to the first sentence, the load of `flag` and the load of `turn` do have an order in the single 
total order <i>S</i> since they are both `memory_order::seq_cst` operations. However, since they are unsequenced, 
the second sentence does not apply to them. So, what's the order of them in <i>S</i>? Is the order of them in 
<i>S</i> unspecified?
<p/>
<b>Suggested Resolution:</b>
<p/>
We may want to say the order of such operations is indeterminate in the single total order. That is,  
either <i>A</i> precedes <i>B</i> or <i>B</i> precedes <i>A</i>, but it is unspecified which.
